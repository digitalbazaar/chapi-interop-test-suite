  // =================
  // WebdriverIO supports Sauce Labs, Browserstack, and Testing Bot (other cloud providers

  // If you run your tests on SauceLabs you can specify the region you want to run your tests
  // in via the `region` property. Available short handles for regions are `us` (default) and `eu`.
  // These regions are used for the Sauce Labs VM cloud and the Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud.
  // If you don't provide the region it will default for the `us`
  region: 'us',

  // Test runner services
  // Services take over a specific job you don't want to take care of. They enhance

  // commands. Instead, they hook themselves up into the test process.
